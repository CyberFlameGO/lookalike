How to compile Look Alike
-------------------------

We are using the standard Qt compiling engine, QMake. The way to
compile Look Alike is:

   qmake && make

How to compile using debugging information
------------------------------------------

Look Alike uses the standard 'debug' config variable of qmake, see

   http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/qmake-project-files.html

Thus you can activate the debugging options by just setting this
variable:

   qmake debug=yes && make

For making this process easier, it has been added a custom script in
the root directory of the project:

   ./build.sh && make

How to use the debugger
-----------------------

We use GDB to debug Look Alike.
Refer to the GDB documentation for more information:

   https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation/

and:

   http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/docs/library/html/guide/html/Developer_Library_Developing_for_Harmattan_Developer_tools_Debugging_tools_Using_GDB.html

How to compile with optimization flags
--------------------------------------

Look Alike uses the 'opt' custom config variable of qmake.

Optimization is activated by default. Thus you can deactivate this
option by just unsetting this variable:

   qmake opt=no && make

NOTE: Some of the configuration variables are mutually exclusive. For
example, 'debug' and 'opt' are mutually exclusive. Hence, 'debug' has
precedence over 'opt' and will cause 'opt' not to have any effect in
case both are specified in the same compilation.

How to run Look Alike from the command-line
-------------------------------------------

This is how to launch Look Alike from the command line:
